# Empathy and Emotion Tracking Platform
 
Tracking the individuals progress throughout the week, if they were having a good day / bad day and this allows the team leads to support their employees when necessary.
The project is seeking to improve belongingness within teams and therefore, increase team performance.
Developed a slack plugin to track, how employee feels and how its effecting their performance.
Used DynamoDB as the data store, as it is guaranteed less than 10 MS latency.
Used Kibana & Elasticsearch to capture the business metrics such as how many people feeling good/bad in a day.
Used serverless framework AWS SAML for API development to develop in less than dollar infrastructure.
